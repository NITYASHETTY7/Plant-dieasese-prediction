You can run this directly from codespace.
Before you run, upload plant_disease_prediction.keras file in trained_model since it was exceeding github limit i couldn't push here.
You can get plant_disease_prediction.keras file from notebook/plant_disease_prediction.ipynb

I have also uploaded the website in docker hub nitya777/plant_disease_prediction
